<h3>Pig - Exercises list</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Ex1: Count the number of TCP connection per each client IP.</p>
    <p>Ex2: Count the total number of TCP connection having “akamai” in the “SSL Server Hello” field (#111 in the tstat data).</p>
    <p>Ex3: For each client IP, compute the sum of uploaded, downloaded and total (up+down) transmitted bytes.</p>
    <p>Ex4: Find the top 100 users per uploaded bytes.</p>
    <p>Ex5: For each IP in the top 100 list previously computed, find the number of bytes uploaded by the
            largest TCP connection and the percentage of the bytes uploaded by this connection over the total number of uploaded
            bytes.</p>
    <p>Ex6: Find the minimum value of client MSS (mss_c).</p>
    <p>Ex7: Find the percentage of TCP connections with minimum client window (win_min_c) == 1460 over
            the total number of connections.</p>
    <p>Ex8: Calculate the percentage of bytes received by each distinct server port over the total number of
            bytes received by all the server ports.</p>
    <p>Ex9: Find the percentage of flows directed to port 80 over the total number of flows.</p>
